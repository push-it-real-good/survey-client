# Surveys Client - Project 3

## Description

Our team project was to build a survey appliction.  Ours app is very basic one
where each survey has only 1 question.  A user must be signed in before they can
create/view/modify their surveys.  Once the survey has been created, a generated
url is created that can be used by anyone to take the survey.  All responses for
a survey can be viewed by the survey owner.

## General Approach

On the first 1/2 day of the project, we created wireframes/user stories/ERD.
From these files, we discussed the best approach for creating a functioning
survey application for the remainder of the day.

We decided to use pair programming for much of the work, switching partners
several times a day.  Our team held 2 meetings daily, one in the morning and
another at the end of the day.  Normal SCRUM practices were used during these
meetings.

## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles

No real unsolved problems.  Some of the hurdles were making bootstrap play
nice with everything going on with the page.  Having a place for unauthenicated
users to enter their survey responses.
